# Restaurant Inventory Management

Django Delights Inventory is a web application built with Django for managing inventory, menu items, and customer purchases for a restaurant.

## General Features

- Users can log in, log out, and must be logged in to see the views.
- Users can create items for the menu.
- Users can add ingredients to the restaurant’s inventory and update their quantities.
- Users can add the different recipe requirements for each menu item.
- Users can record purchases of menu items (only the ones that are able to be created with what’s in the inventory!).
- Users can view the current inventory, menu items, their ingredients, and a log of all purchases made.

## Apps Overview

The application is organized into three distinct apps for efficient restaurant management. Each app has specific roles contributing to the overall functionality of the system. Below is a summary of the responsibilities and key actions of each app:

1. **Inventory App:**
   - Manages the inventory of ingredients.
   - Allows adding, updating, and viewing available ingredients.

2. **Menu App:**
   - Handles menu items and recipes.
   - Enables the creation of new menu items, association with recipes, and cost calculation.

3. **Purchases App:**

   - Maintains a log of purchase transactions and calculates total revenue.
